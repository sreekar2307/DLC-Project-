# DLC-Project-
Arduino based Project Using MPU6050 Accelerometer 

My project conisted of two ends the Transmitter and a reciever 
transmitter has a MPU6050 and arduino  
Reciver has an arduino and LCD screen 
accrording to the movement measured from the accelerometer a message is trasmitted via 4-bit wired channel to the reciever which is 
displayed on the LCD(16*2)
